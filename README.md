# 🧠 AI Age Checker

AI Age Checker is a computer vision-based project that predicts a person’s age using facial images. It leverages deep learning models trained on facial datasets like UTKFace to estimate age with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Face detection and preprocessing
- 🧠 Age prediction using a deep learning model
- 📂 Accepts image input via file or webcam
- 🔁 Easy to retrain on custom datasets
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras *(or PyTorch if used)*
- NumPy
- UTKFace dataset

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses the [UTKFace dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) which contains over 20,000 facial images with annotations for age, gender, and ethnicity.

**Note**: The dataset is not included in the repo due to size. You can download it separately and place it in a `dataset/` directory.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The model detects a face from the input image using OpenCV.
2. The face is cropped and preprocessed (resized, normalized).
3. A CNN model predicts the age based on facial features.
4. The predicted age is displayed or returned.
